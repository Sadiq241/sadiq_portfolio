# Predicting Income Levels Using Census Data with Machine Learning  

## Overview  
This project aims to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year using census data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project explores and identifies key factors influencing income levels and builds an accurate predictive model.  

## Objectives  
- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Understand the dataset and handle missing values, outliers, and data transformations.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Engineer features to enhance model accuracy and insights.  
- **Model Development**: Build and train a machine learning model to classify income levels.  
- **Evaluation**: Use appropriate performance metrics to evaluate the model's effectiveness.  
- **Insights**: Derive actionable insights about the factors influencing income levels.  

## Features  
- **Data Exploration**: Detailed analysis and visualization of the census dataset.  
- **Model Training**: Implementation of machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or others.  
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identification of the most influential features impacting income.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries/Tools**:  
  - Data Manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy`  
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
  - Machine Learning: `scikit-learn`
